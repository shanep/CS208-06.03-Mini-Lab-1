Complete the drawTriangle() function in index.js using GitHub Codespaces. 

The function should output a triangle with asterisks (*) based on the triangleSize parameter. 
Change the argument to different numbers to verify that your function works with any positive integer. 

Ex: drawTriangle(4) outputs to the console a triangle with triangleSize 4, so the longest side (4 asterisks) appears on the bottom line:

    *
    **
    ***
    ****



Hint: Use a loop to output each line of asterisks. The number of asterisks should increase by one each time the loop iterates.
